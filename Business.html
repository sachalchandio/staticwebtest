                Satellite internet emerges as the preferred choice for business
                backup services due to its outstanding advantages. Unlike
                traditional land-based connections, satellite internet offers
                superior speeds, reaching up to 100 Mbps, along with flexible
                data options and enhanced resilience, surpassing the
                capabilities of mobile hotspots. One of its key benefits is its
                widespread availability, ensuring high-speed backup internet
                wherever your business operates—whether in an office, site, or
                any location. Viasat's satellite internet coverage spans 99% of
                the U.S., providing reliable broadband speeds across the
                country. Viasat Business Internet stands out for its swift
                installation process.
